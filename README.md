Got it! To preserve the formatting (like tables, code blocks, and headings) when you copy and paste the README into GitHub, you need to use Markdown syntax. Below is the same content written in proper Markdown format. You can copy and paste this directly into your README.md file on GitHub, and it will render beautifully.

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of my solutions to HackerRank SQL problems. These problems cover a wide range of SQL concepts, including:
- Basic queries
- Joins
- Aggregations
- Subqueries
- Advanced filtering
- Window functions
- And more!

I solved these problems to improve my SQL skills and prepare for technical interviews. I hope these solutions can help others who are learning SQL or preparing for coding challenges.
